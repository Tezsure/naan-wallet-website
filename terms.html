            <h1 class="section-heading">TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS </h1>

            <div class="policies">
              <p class="policy-desc">These terms will automatically apply to you if you download or use the app;
                consequently, you should read them carefully before using the program. You
                are not permitted to imitate our trademarks in any form. Tezsure Inc. owns all
                trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights
                associated with it.</p>
              <p class="policy-desc">Tezsure Inc. is dedicated to making the app as helpful and efficient as possible.
                As a result, we retain the right to modify the app or charge for its services at
                any moment and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its
                services unless we make it very clear what you are paying for.</p>

              <p class="policy-desc">It is your duty to keep your phone and app access safe. As a result, we advise
you not to jailbreak or root your phone, which is the act of eliminating
software restrictions and constraints imposed by your device&#39;s official
operating system. It may expose your phone to malware/viruses/malicious
apps and weaken your phone&#39;s security features and it indicates that the app is
not working properly.</p>


              <h2 class="section-secondary-heading">Conditions for Usage</h2>
              <p class="policy-desc">You should be informed that there are some things for which Tezsure Inc. will
                not accept responsibility. Certain functionality of the program will need an
                active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your
                mobile network carrier, however Tezsure Inc. cannot be held liable if the app
                does not function properly, or if you don&#39;t have access to Wi-Fi and you&#39;ve
                used up all of your data allocation.</p>

              <p class="policy-desc">If you use the app outside of a Wi-Fi hotspot, keep in mind that the conditions
                of your mobile network provider&#39;s agreement will still apply. As a
                consequence, your mobile carrier may charge you for the cost of data for the
                length of the connection while accessing the app, as well as additional third-
                party expenses. You accept responsibility for any such charges by using the
                service, including roaming data costs if you use the app outside of your home
                area (i.e., region or country) without turning off data roaming. Please be aware
                that if you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the app,
                
                we will presume that you have gotten permission from the bill payer to use the
                app.</p>

              <p class="policy-desc">Similarly, Tezsure Inc. cannot always accept responsibility for how you use the
                software, i.e. You must keep your device charged â€“ if it runs out of energy/
                battery and you are unable to switch it on to use the Service, Tezsure Inc.
                cannot bear responsibility.</p>

                <p class="policy-desc">Regarding Tezsure Inc.&#39;s responsibility for your use of the app, it&#39;s essential to
                  remember that, while we strive to keep the app up to date and correct at all
                  times, we do rely on third parties to give information to us so that we may
                  make it available to you. Tezsure Inc. takes no responsibility for any financial or
                  other damage, direct or indirect, that you suffer as a result of depending solely
                  on this app&#39;s functioning.</p>

                  <p class="policy-desc">We may want to upgrade the app at some time. The software is presently
                    accessible for only Android devices. The system requirements (and any more
                    systems to which we decide to expand the app&#39;s availability) may change, and
                    you will need to download updates if you wish to continue using the app.
                    Tezsure Inc. does not guarantee that it will always update the app so that it is
                    relevant to you and/or works with the version of your device that you have
                    installed. You do, however, commit to always accept application updates when
                    they are made available to you. We may also decide to discontinue supplying
                    the app and may terminate your usage of it at any time without providing you
                    any notice of termination. Unless we advise you differently, upon termination,
                    (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will expire; and (b) you
                    must cease using the app and (if necessary) erase it from your device.</p>

              

              <h2 class="section-secondary-heading">Changes to these Terms and Conditions</h2>
              <p class="policy-desc">We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are
                advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of
                any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.</p>
