        <h3 id="info-text">What is a Decentralized App (DApp)?</h3>
        <p class="faqText">A Decentralized App (DApp) is a website or app that uses decentralized protocols for some or
            all aspect of
            its operation.</p>
        <p class="faqText">All DApps available on Naan are built on the Tezos blockchain. Tezos is a decentralized
            protocol capable of
            running smart contracts - computer code that is stored and run by a decentralized network of computers
            around the world.</p>
        <p class="faqText">DApps powered by smart contracts that are deployed on chain with verifiable source code are
            trustless and
            uncensorable because it is run in a deterministic and distributed fashion by computers around the world.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-row">
        <h3>What can I do with DApps?</h3>
        <p class="faqText">The wide variety of DApps already launched allow you to do different things - exchange tokens
            trustlessly, buy and trade collectibles that live on the blockchain, earn money, make
            payments and more. The Naan team curates a list of popular and useful DApps.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-row"><h3>What is "tez" and how do I obtain it?</h3>
        <p class="faqText">Tez or XTZ is the main cryptocurrency on the Tezos blockchain. You need tez to make
            transactions and pay for
            transaction fees (gas) on the network. Tez can be bought through Naan wallet with a credit card or on all
            major cryptocurrency
            exchanges like <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>, <a
                    href="https://www.kraken.com/">Kraken</a>, or <a href="https://www.binance.com/">Binance</a>.</p>
        <p class="faqText">Once you own some tez, you can transfer tez to your Naan Wallet account by sending tez from
            your
            exchange account to your wallet address. You can find and copy your wallet address by pressing "Receive" on
            Naanâ€™s
            wallet tab. We suggest transferring a small amount first as a test to ensure you are doing it correctly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-row"><h3>What is gas?</h3>
        <p class="faqText">Gas is the execution fee for every transaction made on the Tezos blockchain. Suggested gas
            fees rise and
            fall depending on the volume of transactions being made on the network.</p>
